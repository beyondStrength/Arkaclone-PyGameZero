# Arkaclone-PyGameZero
Arkanoid Clone made with PyGameZero
As this game is always in the plan to teach kids about games. hehe

I'm trying new libraries with Python to teach programming to kids, and nothing cooler than creating games, right!?
I'm in love with the PyGameZero, I've tried the PyGame in the past, but for the kids I think it's a little bit confusing and too much work to do simple things.
What I like about PyGameZero it that it keep things simple, like it should be.
